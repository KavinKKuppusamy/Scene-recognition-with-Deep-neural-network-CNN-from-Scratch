# Scene-recognition-with-Deep-neural-network-CNN-from-Scratch
Experimenting with CNN models built with ConV layer, maxpooling layer, softmax layer and fully connected layer to evaluate its performance on scene recognition and detection datasets. The algorithm is implemented on Intel image classification datasets from Kaggle and we obtained the accuracy of 19%
